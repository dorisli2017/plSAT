 parallel local search of SAT problem <br />

todo: <br />
1.parallel processes. stop if other processes succeed. check the global flag . should (similiar as the minimum value in test)<br />
2. share information (best current assignment/global tabu things amang the processes/share lookuptable)<br />
3. exchange information to get genetic algorithm<br />

<br /> 
doing:make sure the local search is the original testing one in may References (probSat)<br />
